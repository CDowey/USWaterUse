# US Water Use - Vermont

In June 2018, the USGS released [Estimated Use of Water in the United States County-Level Data for 2015](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5af3311be4b0da30c1b245d8). For a [post on the Vermont Center for Geographic Information blog](https://medium.com/vcgi/mapping-vermonts-water-use-f0d4beb23679) I wrote about the Vermont Geological Survey's work to better understand Vermont's groundwater resources. For this post, I created a series of maps and figures in Python and did some additional digging into Vermont's estimated Water-Use.

### Example Maps

The code for the analysis and figures is included in the Python notebook.
